SQL-data-row-generator
PURPOSE: Generate massive amounts of custom data at one time, including random name generator (first and last), random phone number generator, and controlled random date generation! just a simple, easy to use, java program to assist with adding mock data to project databases. saves time, creates uniquly generated and formated data for your personal use! and just saves the trouble of typing out rows of mock data! (because programmers are lazy!)

Why?: One day I was typing out rows of unqiue data in sql for personal use. I said DANG this takes forever to write! so I made a program that printed the rows for me! but it wasn't as dynamic or user friendly as this one!

USE: Simply Put the program in a complier, run the "speederupper" program. select how many rows you want to generate select the format they are generated in, copy the output and then paste it directly into an "insert" statement under the values in your SQL compiler of your choice!

What I am hoping to add next: In the java edition, I am hoping to add email generator, address generator, and more functionality!
