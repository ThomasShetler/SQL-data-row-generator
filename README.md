# SQL-data-row-generator
 Generate massive amounts of custom data at one time. for mock databases 
 
 USE:
  With the current beta release you have to manuelly edit the file itself to change the types of data that is outputted
  First off you find the colum array and you edit the generator attributes as you feel fits your needs. you need to do this in 2 places
  both are located in the main class. first you  edit the orginal colums array and then you edit the for loop colums re-intilization array
  this first array is currently located at line "118" and the second array is located at "142"
 
 What I am hoping to add next:
  I am hoping to figure out a way we can customize the arrays using scanner line.
  after editing to gnerators of your choice simply run the program and it will ask you how many rows you want to generate
  simply put in the desired about of rows and you
